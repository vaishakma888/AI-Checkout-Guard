== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the risk assessment work? =

The plugin sends minimal customer data (name, phone, address, cart value) to an external AI service that analyzes patterns and returns a risk score. This happens in real-time during checkout (under 200ms) without affecting the customer experience.

= What customer data is collected? =

Only essential checkout information: name, phone number, email, shipping address, pincode, order value, and product categories. No sensitive payment data is ever transmitted.

= Does this slow down checkout? =

No. The risk assessment happens in under 200ms while the customer is still filling out their information. The payment methods update instantly without page reloads.

= Can customers still use COD for high-risk orders? =

Yes, but they may need additional verification like WhatsApp confirmation or SMS OTP. This ensures genuine customers can still complete orders while preventing fraud.

= Will this work with my theme? =

Yes, the plugin works with any theme that uses the modern WooCommerce Checkout Block. It does not modify your theme files or checkout templates.

= What if the risk API is unavailable? =

The plugin includes smart fallbacks. If the risk service is unreachable, it defaults to your configured safe mode (usually showing prepaid methods only).

= How much can this reduce RTO? =

Most stores see 40-60% reduction in RTO orders within the first month, with some achieving up to 80% reduction depending on their customer base and policies.

= Is this compatible with other payment plugins? =

Yes, AI Checkout Guard works alongside existing payment gateways and checkout plugins. It simply controls which methods are available based on risk assessment.

= Can I customize the risk policies? =

Absolutely. You can set custom thresholds for Low/Medium/High risk levels and define specific actions for each, including prepaid incentive amounts and verification requirements.

= How do I track the results? =

The plugin includes a comprehensive dashboard showing daily stats on RTO prevention, prepaid conversions, risk distribution, and estimated savings.
