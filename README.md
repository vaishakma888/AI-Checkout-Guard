## üöÄ About the Plugin

AI Checkout Guard is a smart WooCommerce extension designed to dramatically reduce RTO orders and increase prepaid conversions. It leverages an external AI API to assess customer risk in real time, enabling store owners to make data-driven decisions at the most critical stage of the checkout process.

By intelligently filtering payment methods, the plugin reduces problematic orders without negatively impacting the customer experience for genuine buyers. The result is a significant reduction in RTO, typically by 40-60%, leading to higher profitability and less manual intervention.
